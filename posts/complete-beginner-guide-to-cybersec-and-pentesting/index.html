<p>This is my first post on this blog, and I&rsquo;d like to give some advices I learned while trying to learn CyberSecurity and Pentesting more specifically. This page is subject to <strong>a lot</strong> of changes. By writing these lines, I&rsquo;m still a <strong>beginner</strong> but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t try to help you ! <strong>I&rsquo;ve scattered the web a lot</strong>, searching for the best ressources out there to learn these skills that you may want to learn too if you&rsquo;re here, reading a lot of reviews, asking questions to relevant persons, IRL and on the Internet. I&rsquo;ll try to always give you <strong>links</strong> to discussions thread that speak about the mentionned ressource, so people that know better than myself (and there&rsquo;s a lot) can help you too. I will try to put a section with general advices that can help to <strong>learn a lot of things by yourself</strong>, like CyberSec but in general everything related to <strong>self-taught</strong>. If you have questions or comment that can be useful, you can <a href="/about">PM me</a> on differents socials, I&rsquo;d be happy to talk with you :)</p>
<p>Note : I will use the word &ldquo;pentesting&rdquo; for everything related to CyberSec skills, it&rsquo;s juste more convenient, but a lot of those ressources can be useful for a big range of <strong>Computer Skills</strong>.</p>

<p>0 -&gt; The start of the start. Ressources and advices for people who barely know what a <strong>VM</strong> is, who don&rsquo;t know how to use <strong>Linux</strong>, don&rsquo;t have <strong>Basic Networking Knowledge</strong> and these kind of stuff. If you don&rsquo;t understand a heck about what I&rsquo;m talking about, then you should <strong>really</strong> start here.</p>
<h1 id="00-foreword"><strong>[0.0] Foreword</strong><a href="#00-foreword" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Pentesting, CyberSec, Hacking, call it what you want, is <strong>Hard</strong>. I don&rsquo;t want to discourage you, but let&rsquo;s be honnest, it is. You would&rsquo;nt call yourself a writer because you wrote 2 essays at school that gave you a great mark or if you just red a lot of books. To become a writer, you have to write. Well to become a Pentester, <strong>you have to pentest</strong>. If possible <strong>everyday</strong> depending of your schedule. You have to do as much hands-on as you can, when you learn something, see something new, <strong>try it</strong> immediatly, the information is fresh in your brain, and you don&rsquo;t want it to go, so do it <strong>again and again and again and again</strong>, that&rsquo;s one of the best advice for everything self-taught. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s <strong>really</strong> important to read man pages, take courses (just don&rsquo;t take so many that you will end up not going deep enough for each subject) but <strong>hands-on</strong> is what will make the <strong>knowledge</strong> stick in your head for <strong>ever</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="01-pre-requisites"><strong>[0.1] Pre Requisites</strong><a href="#01-pre-requisites" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Here, I will list <strong>ressources</strong> that can help you build that strong <strong>Basic Knowledge</strong> about computers in general that you&rsquo;re <strong>definitely</strong> gonna need. Pentesting is kind of requiring you to know a lot of skills related to <strong>Computer Science</strong>.</p>
<p>If you start from here, I just want to say that it&rsquo;s going to be a <strong>looooong</strong> journey, so buckle up, get motivated, and don&rsquo;t stop until you <strong>achieved your goal</strong>.</p>
<p>First of all is English, you&rsquo;re gonna need it. If it&rsquo;s not your foreign language, learn it as much as you can, it must become your new language, think in English, do everything computer-related in English, watch movies/shows/news in English, read books, use translators whenever you find a word you didn&rsquo;t know about before, everything will help you.</p>
